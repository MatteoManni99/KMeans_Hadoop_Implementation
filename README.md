In this project, I collaborated with a team to implement the K-Means Algorithm in a distribuited way. In particular, we exploited the MapReduce approach. We leveraged the Hadoop framework, including HDFS and YARN, to develop a Java application. The application is able to apply k-means clustering to an input dataset and processing it in a parallelized manner.
We carried out several experiments in order to prove that our application scale better than standard implementations. We used as comparison the scikit-learn implementation.
