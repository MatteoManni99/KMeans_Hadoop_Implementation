# KMeans Hadoop Implementation
In this project, I collaborated with my team to implement the k-means clustering algorithm using a MapReduce approach. We leveraged the Hadoop framework, including HDFS and YARN, to develop a Java application. This application is able to apply k-means clustering to an input dataset and processing it in a parallelized manner.
