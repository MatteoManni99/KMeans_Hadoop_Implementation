In this project, I collaborated with my team to implement the k-means clustering algorithm using a MapReduce approach. We leveraged the Hadoop framework, including HDFS and YARN, to develop a Java application. This application is able to apply k-means clustering to an input dataset and processing it in a parallelized manner.
We compered the time that is required to our application to process datasets to the time required to the implementation of scikit-learn. Our program obviously is slower but the increment time in percentage if we try to put in input a larger dataset is very smaller, so we can say that it works. 
We compared the time required for our application to process datasets with the time required for the implementation of scikit-learn.
